\placeholder{Problem description} 
\\
In 2023 Hasso Plattner is launching his own currency (HPC). In the basement of the newly build buildings at Campus 2 the money press will be guarded by a complex alarm system. 
You want to be able to print your own HPC and therefore you need the money printing plates from the basement. 
In the basement is a long hallway of dimensions (width 10m and length 100m) separates you from money press. There are n motion detectors on the ceiling that detect intruders if they pass within a circular range of r. 
Your goal is to find out, if it is possible to reach the other end of the hallway without triggering the alarm. 

\paragraph*{Input}
\placeholder{Input description}
n: an integer that describes the number of motion detectors \\
followed by n lines of:
$x_i$, $y_i$ and $r_i$: the position and the range of the ith motion detector


\paragraph*{Output}
\placeholder{Output description}
“Yes” if it is possible to reach the other end of the hallway \\
“No” if it is not possible to reach the other end of the hallway
